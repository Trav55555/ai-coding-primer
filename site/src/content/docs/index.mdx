## Quick Recommendations

| Your Situation | Start With |
|----------------|------------|
| **New to AI coding** | [Zed](https://zed.dev) or [Cursor](https://cursor.com) — easiest setup |
| **Privacy-first** | [Continue.dev](https://continue.dev) + [Ollama](https://ollama.com) — 100% local |
| **Already use VS Code** | [Continue.dev](https://continue.dev) or [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) |
| **Terminal workflow** | [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) or [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) |
| **Enterprise/compliance** | [Continue.dev](https://continue.dev) self-hosted or [Cursor Teams](https://cursor.com) |

## The Golden Rule

> **Start with tasks you already know how to solve.** This builds intuition for when the AI is right vs. hallucinating before you rely on it for unfamiliar territory.
