This is a practical guide to AI-assisted coding — from your first prompt to production workflows.

## Who This Is For

- **Developers new to AI tools** who want a clear path from zero to productive
- **Experienced developers** looking for best practices and tool comparisons
- **Tech leads** evaluating tools for their teams

## What You'll Learn

1. **Getting Started** — Choose a tool, set up your environment, run your first session
2. **Working Effectively** — Patterns that work, mistakes to avoid, when to give up and code it yourself
3. **Tools & Models** — Detailed comparisons with real pricing and capabilities
4. **Security & Privacy** — What data goes where, enterprise considerations

## How to Use This Guide

**If you're new to AI coding:** Start with [What is AI Coding?](/ai-coding-primer/learn/beginner/what-is-ai-coding/) and work through the Getting Started section in order.

**If you're already using AI tools:** Jump to [Effective Patterns](/ai-coding-primer/learn/intermediate/effective-patterns/) or the specific tool/model pages you need.

**If you're evaluating for a team:** Start with [Tool Comparison](/ai-coding-primer/tools/comparison/) and [Security & Privacy](/ai-coding-primer/security/checklist/).

## Philosophy

This guide is **opinionated**. We make recommendations rather than listing every option. We prioritize:

- **Practical over comprehensive** — Real examples, not abstract theory
- **Fresh over complete** — Fewer accurate pages beat many stale ones
- **Honest about limitations** — AI coding has failure modes; we cover them
