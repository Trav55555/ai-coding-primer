description: Empirical findings behind AI coding outcomes.
---

This section collects research on AI-assisted development outcomes.

The core learning path in this guide stays practical by design. These pages provide the supporting evidence, including caveats, sample limitations, and scope notes.

## How to Read This Section

- Treat results as directional, not universal rules
- Prefer first-party studies and official reports
- Check publication dates before applying a claim
- Look at methodology before copying a headline number

## What You'll Find

- [Productivity Research](/ai-coding-primer/research/productivity/) — mixed results, context-dependent gains
- [Code Quality & Security](/ai-coding-primer/research/code-quality-security/) — defect and vulnerability patterns
- [Adoption & Trends](/ai-coding-primer/research/adoption-trends/) — usage, trust, and workflow changes
- [Learning Impacts](/ai-coding-primer/research/learning-impacts/) — skill development, cognitive effects, the performance-learning paradox

## Scope Note

Many studies measure specific cohorts, tasks, and tool setups. If your team context differs, validate with your own pilot metrics.
