AI coding productivity results are mixed.

## Key Findings

- **METR (2025, updated 2026):** Experienced developers were about 19% slower in the tested setup, despite perceiving themselves as faster.
- **DORA 2025:** AI tends to amplify existing team strengths and weaknesses rather than fix process issues on its own.
- **Practical takeaway:** Gains are strongest when teams have tight feedback loops, clear ownership, and reliable verification.

## Why Results Conflict

- Different studies measure different tasks (greenfield vs maintenance)
- Tool configuration and model selection vary widely
- Team maturity changes outcomes as much as model quality

## How to Apply This

- Run a scoped pilot on your own codebase
- Measure PR cycle time, review time, and rework rate
- Track quality outcomes, not just code volume
