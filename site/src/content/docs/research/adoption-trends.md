description: Usage patterns, trust signals, and ecosystem movement.

Adoption is high, but trust and consistency lag.

## Observed Trends

- AI coding is now mainstream in day-to-day development workflows.
- Teams report a rising share of AI-assisted committed code.
- Trust in output quality remains uneven, especially for high-risk changes.

## Ecosystem Signals

- Agentic workflows are becoming standard in IDE and CLI products.
- MCP adoption is expanding across major vendors and open-source tooling.
- Product pricing and model availability change quickly; static tables age fast.

## What This Means for Teams

- Tool adoption is no longer the hard part; governance is
- The bottleneck shifts from writing code to validating code
- Tool/model policies should be reviewed on a fixed cadence
