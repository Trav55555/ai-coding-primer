description: What recent research says about AI tools and skill development.

AI boosts immediate task performance but can undermine the deep learning that builds lasting skill.

## The Performance-Learning Paradox

- **OECD Digital Education Outlook (2026):** AI-assisted students scored 48% higher on practice tasks but 17% lower on unassisted exams.
- **March 2025 meta-analysis (13 studies):** Positive effect size g=0.86 for AI in education, but effectiveness depends heavily on instructional model.
- **Wang & Fan (2025):** ChatGPT meta-analysis found significant performance improvement (g=0.867) but only moderate effects on higher-order thinking.

## Cognitive Effects

- **MIT Media Lab "Your Brain on ChatGPT" (2025, preprint):** EEG study of 54 participants. ChatGPT users showed lowest brain engagement, reduced frontal-parietal connectivity (working memory, executive function), and struggled with recall and originality afterward.
- **Gerlich (2025):** Negative correlation between frequent AI use and critical thinking. Younger users showed highest dependence.
- **Walther (2026, Stanford):** Introduced the concept of "cognitive surrender" — offloading reasoning itself, not just memory.

## Coding-Specific Findings

- **Anthropic RCT (Jan 2026):** 52 developers learning a Python library. AI group scored 17% lower on comprehension (50% vs 67%). Largest gap appeared in debugging. Developers who used AI for conceptual questions retained more.
- **Shen & Tamkin (2026):** Heavy AI reliance reduced new skill acquisition. Delegating code generation led to failed unassisted quizzes.
- **Prather et al. (2024, ACM):** AI exacerbates metacognitive difficulties for novice programmers.
- **METR (early 2025):** Experienced open-source developers were 19% slower with AI tools.

## The Competence Illusion

- **IJRSI (2025):** Documented an "illusion of competence" — the fluency of AI output gets mistaken for personal mastery.
- **Zhang & Xu (2025):** AI boosts perceived self-efficacy while increasing dependence and reducing actual autonomy.
- **Ray et al. (2024):** AI accelerates decay of existing skills and hinders new skill acquisition, often without user awareness.

## When AI Helps Learning

- **Tutor CoPilot RCT (Wang et al., 2024/2025):** AI-human hybrid tutoring produced a 4 percentage point increase in math mastery, +9 p.p. for students of lower-rated tutors. Worked by promoting probing questions rather than direct answers.
- **Ponti (2025, Nature):** A custom pedagogical AI tutor outperformed traditional active learning.
- **Park et al. (2024):** AI that asks questions instead of answering them improved decision-making outcomes.
- **PNAS (2025):** AI without guardrails actively harmed learning. With guardrails, outcomes improved.
- The pattern: AI helps when it scaffolds thinking; hurts when it replaces thinking.

## How to Apply This

- Attempt problems before turning to AI. Struggle is where encoding happens.
- Use AI to explain concepts and ask follow-up questions, not to generate solutions you paste in.
- Test yourself without AI regularly. If you can't reproduce what you built, you didn't learn it.
- For practical patterns, see [Learning with AI](/ai-coding-primer/learn/intermediate/learning-with-ai/).
